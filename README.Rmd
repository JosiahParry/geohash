# geohash

<!-- badges: start -->

`{geohash}` is an R package to provide geohash encoding and decoding. It is based on the [Rust crate geohash](https://docs.rs/geohash). This package is actively under development.

You can watch me create this package in my [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/yaxfqpECIZ0).

## Installation

You can install the development version of geohash like so:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("josiahparry/geohash")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
# geohash doesn't have any exported functions yet
atlanta <- geohash:::encode(-84, 33, 12)
atlanta

geohash:::decode(atlanta)
```



What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
